# i3 with Gnome session

These are configuration files required for i3 to be started as Gnome session. Running i3 window manager this way means GTK+ themes, Gnome configuration, DBus and other services are started along with i3 ensuring everything is as configured as possible without extra work.

Please note these files were created for Debian Testing. If you are not using Debian based distro you might get different results.
